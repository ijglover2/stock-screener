Project deliverables and scope:
Website for modern browsers. Possibly a mobile app as well



Project languages and frameworks

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (possibly use jquery, react, vue, angular)

Backend: Python (Could also use one of these too: Ruby on Rails, PHP, Node.js, Express.js,)
if wanting to use lower level language could use: C#, Java (I don't recommend this)

Possible way forward for the stack

Python is very good for data mining and data analysis
